				<h1>Melon</h1>
				<p><b>Melon Core Library</b> is a core library or software framework that tries to balance being simple, well designed and easy to use. It's intended to be a replacement for the C standard library that respects programmers more.</p>
				<p>It also has some bias to games programming, though I'm not completely focused on that since I think games are often an excuse to make a buggy mess.</p>

				<h2>What is the scope?</h2>
				<p>I want Melon to be like the Web APIs for programming in C. For me, this includes things like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Logging</li>
					<li>Sandboxed file and storage API ^</li>
					<li>Tables (aka dictionaries or assocative array) ^</li>
					<li>Time utilities (e.g. hiresTimeInSec())</li>
					<li>Windowing support</li>
					<li>Threading helper functions ^</li>
					<li>Pseudorandom number generation</li>
					<li>2D and 3D graphics drawing *</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics">Vector graphics</a> *</li>
					<li>Compression algorithms *</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units">GPU compute</a> *</li>
					<li>Geometry, shape and scene APIs *</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">Graphs</a></li>
					<li>Cryptography wraper (delegated to libsodium or similar) ^</li>
					<li>Networking support with HTTP helpers ^</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system">Computer algebra system</a> *</li>
				</ul>
				<p>* = There is currently no module to handle this.</p>
				<p>^ = The module for this isn't complete.</p>
				<p>That is, of course, quite a lot, and since it is meant to be a proper educational exprience, it may take a long time or be flaky in some areas, but that is okay!</p>
