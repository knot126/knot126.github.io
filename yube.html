				<p><b>Yube</b> is a small video streaming site that I am currently developing on the side.</p>
				<p>Currently, basically everything is missing &mdash; there is no users, authentication, likes, uploading, recommendations, copyright system, video processing nor is there currently any real thought behind streaming tech, which is very important.</p>
				<p>Just to make it worse, it's written in the Python default HTTP server. So it will need a rewrite sooner or later.</p>
				<p>In the future, I hope this project can serve as an educational exprience about video streaming, something I am instrested in (along with thousands of other things).</p>
