				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>Hello, I'm Knot! I enjoy programming, reverse engineering and maths. Some of my previous areas of focus have been calculus, making games, reverse engineering of various types, cryptography, compilers and language design. I really like to chat about any of this stuff and learn more when I can - don't hesitate to ask questions!</p>
				<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
				<details>
					<summary id="programming-language">What is your favourite programming language?</summary>
					<p>I can appricate <i>most</i> programming languages, and I'm actually not too opinionated about programming other than not being inconsistent or making things needlessly confusing. I don't really have a favourite language.</p>
					<p>As of writing, if I had to chose one language to program in forever, it would be Python, or failing that C (as of the 2023 standard).</p>

				<details>
					<summary id="the-name">Where does the name "Knot" come from?</summary>
					<p>I was signing up for Fandom, and I wanted a new username. As a result, I randomly chose the word "knot" and number 126 to make my new username "knot126". I ended up liking the name, so it stuck, and it's now what I identify as with my friends.</p>
					<p>The word "knot" refers to a knot that one would tie with a rope. Not anything else.</p>

					<summary id="tails-the-fox">Why do you have an obsession with Tails the Fox?</summary>
					<p>I feel that Tails deeply represents me, more or less. For what it's worth, many other people feel similarly. Ask anyone with a Tails profile picture - there are <i>a lot</i> of them - they may be able to explain similar stuff in more detail!</p>
