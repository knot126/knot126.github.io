				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>I am a software developer or an engineer ... or a mathematican. I can't decide which, though.</p>
				<h2>Things that look intresting</h2>
				<p>I think one good way to learn about me is by what I find to be intresting or worth research. It shows what I think about often. I don't necessarily know a lot about these things.</p>
				<p>In no order ...</p>
				<div class="card-section full-width">
					<h3>The graphics pipeline in GPU compute</h3>
					<p>A completely programmable graphics pipeline is a very, very intresting idea. Even if having RT cores or the traditional rasterisation pipeline is basically guaranteed to be more efficient, I think the programmability will make up for itself.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card-section full-width">
					<h3>High level graphics primitives</h3>
					<p>Instead of just rendering triangles, why not render smooth surfaces, like Bezier patches? NURBS surfaces? Entire implicit equations?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card-section full-width">
					<h3>Procedural content generation</h3>
					<p>Using code as the method of input to an asset, like a texture, model, music, level layout, font or anything else, is a really good idea. It essentially removes the need for a separate preview process as things that be seen directly in engine.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card-section full-width">
					<h3>Encryption</h3>
					<p>It's unusually fun to turn garbage data into something meaningful by just knowing One Weird Trick.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card-section full-width">
					<h3>Mathematics</h3>
					<p>As long as I can properly understand it, if it is mathematics, I will probably like it. (Not like rote learning though &mdash; no times tables bullshit &mdash; I <i>need</i> to understand things.)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card-section full-width">
					<h3>Reverse engineering</h3>
					<p>Taking things apart and putting them back together in intresting ways is very fun. :)</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card-section full-width">
					<h3>Processor design</h3>
					<p>...</p>
