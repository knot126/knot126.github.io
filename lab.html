				<p>The <b>Smash Hit Lab Website</b> &mdash; which is powered by Labbyware, a custom CMS and wiki &mdash; is a mod database, news site and community centre for fans of the mobile game Smash Hit. This is probably the first widely usable project I have made moreso from scratch.</p>
				<div class="card-section">
					<h3><a href="https://smashhitlab.000webhostapp.com">Visit the Smash Hit Lab</a></h3>
					<p>This is the website as it is currently running.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>Features</h2>
				<p>It features the abilities to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>create accounts (and automatically generate passwords for them)</li>
					<li>edit mod database pages (for users of the site)</li>
					<li>make comments and mention users in comments</li>
					<li>delete (hide) individual comments (I would like to point out that Google Chat doesn't have this as a feature.)</li>
					<li>recieve notifications when mentioned or a message is left on your userpage</li>
					<li>edit private or public articles for people with staff or admin priveleges</li>
					<li>moderate the site (banning users and their IPs, hiding comments)</li>
					<li>other various admin tools</li>
					<li>allow users to block each other</li>
					<li>do various maintanance tasks (backups)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The backend was written in PHP, with no frameworks and not using a real database. I don't really like PHP as a language &mdash; I know that few actually do &mdash; but it's what most free webhosts seem to only provide, and it's still one of the fastest "make something from scratch" languages despite having so many quirks.</p>
				<p>As for the database, it's a thin wrapper around the filesystem and JSON encoding, mainly because I don't really enjoy the way SQL is used in practise. For any large site, just having JSON and some folders wouldn't work, but I think for a small site this isn't an issue.</p>
				<p>My favourite part of the codebase is probably either the generic discussions system that handles reviews, comments and message walls or how sending a notification can be done by calling <code>notify($name, $title, $url)</code> (or <code>notify_many</code> or <code>notify_scan</code>). It should probably be behind some kind of event or message system (and I've noted that), but ATM just calling it directly is fine. :)</p>
				<p>I think I could have taken a bit more time at the start to improve code quality, however. The implementation of database was first and I think it's pretty nice because you can just do things like:</p>
				<pre id="code0" class="code">$db = new Database("some_table_name");

if ($db->has("my_object")) {
	$obj = $db->load("my_object");
}
else {
	$db->save("my_object", array("1" => "2", "3" => "4"));
	$obj = $db->load("my_object");
}</pre><script>format_section("code0");</script>
				<p>But other places sometimes work with primitives where functions should probably exist for doing those things. For a long time, for example, there wasn't a nice function to echo out a form to the screen &mdash; which is another issue. I really should not have made the mistake of using <code>echo</code> directly and instead creating a <code>Page</code> class that has methods like <code>append($content)</code>, <code>set_title($title)</code>, etc. I'm working to fix this and the codebase is under 10K lines right now, so I think it might not be too hard to do.</p>
				<p>Security was something I have tried to consider when creating the site, though I know some things I didn't initially think about that would need some work.</p>
