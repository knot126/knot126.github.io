				<h1 id="games-and-modding">Games and reverse engineering</h1>
				<p>I have been involved in reverse engineering video games. Addimttedly, I don't actually play games very much, since I like the game of tech. :P</p>
				<p>By "reverse engineering", I mean I mostly work on tech, and not making new content for games. I think it's intresting to see how various games organise their code and solve problems.</p>

				<p>I have done <i>a lot</i> of things for Smash Hit, to the point where it has been my life for over three years. I am often active on the <a href="https://discord.gg/7kra7Z3UNn">Smash Hit Lab</a> discord server.</p>

				<h3 id="croc">By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonaut_Games">Argonaut Games PLC</a></h3>
				<p>These games have the most intresting tech of any game listed here, mainly becuase most of it is custom. I have been mostly involved with the scripting language for the original <i>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</i> (1997).</p>
