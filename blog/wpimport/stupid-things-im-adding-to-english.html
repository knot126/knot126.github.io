<p>Maybe you can come up with a thousand reasons why I should just learn a perfect synthetic language or at least another language if I’m going to not accept standard English practises. Truthfully, I am trying the latter and the first option sounds interesting. However, English is unfortunately the only language I really know how to convey my feelings well in at the moment, so I will extend it if I feel it is missing something.</p>



<p>Anyways… here is the list of “extensions” (rather more oddities in the way I talk but oh well) I have made, last updated 1 August 2021:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>The suffix <em>-se</em> is similar to the prefix <em>pseudo-</em> when the prefix version sounds worse, but does imply something has partial truth to it as well. Example: <strong>Pseudo</strong>-random -&gt; Random-<strong>se</strong></li><li>I do not always add a comma where there should be one since it conveys the tone better: that is, “The fox ran away, and the cat went to the store.” versus “The fox ran away and the cat went to the store”.</li><li>When quoting something with great precision, the quote will always go before the punctuation and there might be double punctuation on the sentence.</li><li>Title case prefers Wikipedia-like rules, that is, lowercase letters instead of capital letters.</li></ul>
