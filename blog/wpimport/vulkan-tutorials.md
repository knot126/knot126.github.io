# Vulkan Tutorials

TL;DR: Just read the spec and learn how to work a search engine instead of bothering with modern-day Vulkan tutorials. (Unless they work for you.)

I think I might have just figured out why I do not like any of the Vulkan tutorials I have seen: they just tell you things that you basically already know. Their content would be better suited to a manpage; a reference.

As a quick disclaimer, this is from the experience of reading a few of them and then reading the spec and wondering why I can read a more technical document and be less confused about it. I am not the most experienced CG programmer ever, which is why I even write this in the first place.

Most of the tutorials about Vulkan already assume you are an “experienced (CG) programmer” (which in itself is kind of arbitrary and usually not defined), and that you know what you are doing. But doesn’t knowing what you are doing defeat the point of the tutorial? If you know what you are doing, why don’t you just go shove your face [in the spec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/index.html) or a manpage and learn it much faster and better, from the people who would know how to explain it best? Plus, if you don’t understand one specific thing, there are many search engines that would be happy to take your traffic.

I liked LearnOpenGL because it didn’t just teach you OpenGL: it taught you everything you needed to know in order to work with OpenGL, and explained things very plainly, even having a built-in, inline manpage viewer for when you forgot what something did! Most Vulkan tutorials don’t do that kind of stuff: they just explain how to use the API in a long, boring paragraph, even though that’s what reference pages are for since they can tell you what it does without pushing in a bunch of [bloated words](https://youtu.be/TKOr43VmlC0?t=1959).

I think I also comes down to understanding. You don’t really understand an API in the same way you do a maths concept, for example: the API usually just boils down to being classified as client-server, object-oriented or whatever and the exact way to invoke it (95% of knowing an API) is just details and memorisation, while the maths concept requires actual understanding of how things work.

Of course, if Vulkan tutorials work better for you, I would love to know what makes them that way. I could see a tutorial explaining some concepts better than the spec, for example. For me, though, I think Vulkan tutorials will only really get good when they start to apply to people without CG experience.
