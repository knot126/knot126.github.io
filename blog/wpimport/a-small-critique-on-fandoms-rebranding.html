<p><em>This was originally posted on the megathread; I’ll post it here in case it gets removed.</em></p>



<p>Firstly, I think the logo and colour scheme are really nice. They are fairly unique yet simple, and they do fit together quite well. For a normal company, this would be very good branding.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Fandom is not really one of these “normal” companies. Instead of just being a brand that an everyday consumer should remember – like the brand of milk you buy at your local store – they are a brand that people who interact with everyday consumers should remember – like a supplier of cow food might be to a farmer that sells milk. In other words: they provide a service to people who provide services; they don’t provide a service themselves.</p>



<p>Fandom is a wiki and community hosting company. Maybe that’s not what they want to be – but that IS what they are, and they need to realise that. They aren’t going to make everyday people suddenly care about who they are. Do you know who the host of your favourite blog is? Is it WordPress? Blogger? Maybe it’s just a Google Site? Wix? You probably don’t know, because these are examples of what good hosting companies do: they market to the people that want to make the content, not the people that are just stopping by to read it.</p>



<p>When you look up a recipe, do you care about grandma’s story? No. But that is what fandom is basically trying to do: they are trying to make people who really just want a single piece of information and nothing more to notice their brand when that’s really something they just won’t do. The average consumer will never need to learn more about Fandom and never need to make an account or learn about the brand because they are just looking for the information that the wiki provides. They are not looking to host a wiki; the service that Fandom provides.</p>



<p>When you go to Wikipedia, do you ever notice how they say only 2% of readers donate? And how it’s so annoying that they make those pop-ups? That’s because most people are just looking for the information hosted on Wikipedia, they don’t really care about helping it. They are looking to quickly find information in an effective and fast manner that will answer their question, not contribute to a project. They aren’t looking for information about a free encyclopedia they can contribute to; instead, they are looking for information.</p>



<p>Really, this is just to say: Fandom is marketing to the wrong audience for the wrong purpose. They are trying to market to the people who just want to find information and don’t really care about finding a platform, when perhaps they just need to accept that their platform is better for a slightly more niche group of people who actually create and maintain these communities. Perhaps that’s who they should direct their brand to: the people who will actually be interested in using their services.</p>



<p>Fandom is a wiki and community hosting provider that is trying to sell itself to people who don’t need those services. It feels like such a naïve mistake to make, but looking at it now, it’s quite clear that’s what is happening, at least to some extent.</p>
