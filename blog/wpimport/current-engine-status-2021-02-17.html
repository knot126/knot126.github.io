<p>This is going to be the first time I write about my game engine publicly. At this point, it has only been in development for a few weeks, but I am able to draw 2D things. Since I’ve never really developed any real software before – especially not anything that needs to have structure or maintainability – this has been an interesting experience for me, already.</p>



<p>Currently, I have a few little nice things set up: a custom memory allocator that is really buggy (my first <a href="https://github.com/mtrebi/memory-allocators#free-list-allocator">free-list allocator</a>; I’m rewriting before I get too far, it’s already caused me a lot of pain), a very basic event system (called “flags” in the codebase), a file system wrapper (the only thing I’m not going to complain about today), a <a href="https://blog.tuxedolabs.com/2013/03/08/mediocre-properties.html">Dennis Gustafasson-style</a> property bag system (which segfaults thanks to the buggy allocator) and some other smaller utilities.</p>



<p>The primary part of the engine (currently just the drawing) uses OpenGL, GLFW and GLEW. You may ask “why not Vulkan?” And I asked that too. There are really two reasons for not going with Vulkan primarily: it is still not very tutorial-rich for the way I learn and none of the games I play, really like and want to do modding with actually use it, so it is rather awkward because outside of my engine, there isn’t much use for it. I would <em>really</em> love to make my engine Vulkan-only, but I can’t even bring myself to learn Vulkan at the moment because it’s just not relevant for me. Perhaps I will add support in the future, but I think there will need to be something like <a href="https://learnopengl.com">learnopengl.com</a> for Vulkan. (This is actually not to mention that I have no hardware with Vulkan support on Windows, which I need to port to eventually.)</p>



<p>The eventual goal with the engine is to make it a 3D engine for a game I am trying to work on. Nothing really large or groundbreaking, but something that can be expanded upon. So far, I think I have done a good job at being flexible. I will focus on being fast later.</p>



<p>I can’t really say much more than that. One thing: I’m not using C++; instead, I am using C. I don’t really hate C++; I just think it’s a bit much for someone who just wants to write an engine and do it well. C++, to me, is more for the people that are (a) on a time and cost budget, (b) would rather not have things look really ugly when you go to add something to a list and (c) really like object-oriented programming. I don’t hate OOP, but I don’t really like it much either.</p>
