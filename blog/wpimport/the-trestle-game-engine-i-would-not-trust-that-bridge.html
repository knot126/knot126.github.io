<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>aka: Why you should make your own engine, and why everything’s going to be alright.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>For an explanation of my stupid extensions to English (and so the title), <a href="https://knot126.wordpress.com/2021/08/01/stupid-things-im-adding-to-english/">see here</a>.</em></p>



<p>For those who do not know, I am working on a 3D game engine, called the <em>Trestle Engine</em>, or at least that is what I am calling it for now. For those who also do not know, prior to starting on the engine, I had very little programming experience – sure, I could write a “Hello World” in C and maybe allocate some memory using <code>malloc</code>, but other than that, I couldn’t really do much.</p>



<p>Five or six or seven months in, and I think I’ve gotten somewhere: I can make a very basic game in my engine. Sure, the collisions are restricted to AABBs (boxes without rotation), the GUI system is just not present (I need to rewrite it) and I would rather be using Vulkan instead of dealing with OpenGL and its Legacy Software Simplexity™ (and also since OpenGL is effectively dead now).</p>



<p>Perhaps this already sounds like a mess – or at the very least non-optimal – and I can safely say that it is. I am not going to sit here defending myself or what I have created: I could be doing things a lot better, and I will try to get better as much as I can. I really shouldn’t be trying to implement <em>everything</em> (sans OpenGL context creation and management) myself and I should probably work a bit more on the engine than I have, rewriting the parts that don’t work. Perhaps it seems like I should give up and not play the game at all – after all, you can’t loose if you don’t try.</p>



<p>But of course, that is always the most pessimistic view, and it’s just one viewpoint about it. Some will debate weather not trying means loosing, winning or something else altogether, but really, it just sort of is. Sometimes, you just need to be reminded of that: things just are, there is rarely any intent in anything. Take a breath and perhaps a sort break, get some rest and come back when you are ready (even if it is midnight in your specific location).</p>



<p>Back to what I was talking about: I think that making a custom engine is worth it. It will give your game a unique feel while also allowing you to understand exactly how things work under the hood so you can fix most issues that you encounter. </p>



<p>Games made in a specific engine look and feel similar: games made in Godot will have it’s really weird dark-toned blue-hue by default, Unity games will always taste like a flavourless chunk of that slightly warm default model colour, Game Maker games will always be… Game Maker games, and <em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em> will always feel like it was made in the 1990’s engine it was made in, <a href="https://hexadecimalmantis.tumblr.com/post/185595678598/argonaut-games-research">allegedly terrible scripting language</a> and all. Your engine plays into as much of the game as your game itself does – it adds a whole feel to the game itself. Making a custom game engine allows you to define that feeling, even if it’s not something that you can completely control.</p>



<p>And of course, you will learn a lot by making a custom engine. Just making a small subset of my custom engine has forced to learn so many new things that I really like knowing, even things that are unrelated to the engine as a whole: I found out that programming language design (and more specifically, compiler design) are actually quite simple and very interesting! (I would recommend <a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> to anyone curious, even if I’ve not completed the book even halfway.) I learnt that matrix maths are simple <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-multiplying.html">until they’re not</a>, and that graphics using OpenGL are actually fun to work with, if you have <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">the right book</a>.</p>



<p>But … Do I feel any better about my game than when I was working with Godot or Unity? I am happy to say that yes, I do feel better. </p>



<p>Just because my (or perhaps – your) engine isn’t complete after half a year of on-and-off work doesn’t mean it never will be done (or so I figure now – I suppose we will see if I die of starvation or have even a bit of modest success with my game when I launch it).</p>



<p>I recommend creating your own tech and/or engine, despite what other people will say (if you want to do it, that is). You will be so happy with yourself – not just after the engine is done, but after every little thing that you manage to accomplish. And you will almost certainly be paying more cares to every little detail about the game, and gain an appreciation for how things come together. Ultimately, a focus on marketing and just getting it done using the easiest tool will get a game out there, but creating your own engine might make it the slightest bit more interesting and let you see things you never thought you would.</p>



<p>Then again, I am just some guy on the internet who can’t even pronounce his own username correctly, so take it with a grain of salt – and know that I’ve not really shipped a game before! If you do really feel more comfortable in Unityland or Godotland, then you should stay there if you are really happy with it. And of course, I hope that at least half of my audience disagrees with me on some grounds – opposing viewpoints are almost always a good thing on the internet.</p>
