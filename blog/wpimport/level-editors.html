<p>I don’t <em>exactly</em> know what I am going to write about today, but I am just going to write about something interesting to me: level editors. I think they’re really interesting just because of what they do. They’re the ultimate data manipulation tool for a game (and its engine), and they do most of the hard work when it comes to content creation for the game. But there is something else interesting about them, too: they allow (or disallow, I will get to that) fans and modders to make their own content for the game, thereby increasing its lifespan.</p>



<p>I have personally really liked the idea of building an editor right into the game since I first heard about it. It seems quite connivent to be able to preview right then and there, and some of the more common “drawbacks” have easy workarounds. This is also really interesting because it allows for easier testing of ideas for level design.</p>



<p>What I also think is interesting is when developers do and don’t decide to include a level editor in their game. While I would certainly be more inclined to say that developers should include level creation tools in their games (have you looked at the front page of the blog?), I think there are valid reasons for not doing that: for example, it makes it harder if you ever want to do a sequel, because then you have to work harder to get people to play the second game, especially if it doesn’t add much onto the original base-game.</p>



<p>And then, I think its really interesting when fans of a game go out of their way to make custom level editors for their favourite games because the developers have decided not to release an editor officially. (Technically, I’ve “done that” with something called <a href="https://smashingmods.fandom.com/wiki/Knot126/Smash_Hit_Blender_Tools">Smash Hit Blender Tools</a>, but that’s not really its own editor.) This is especially true for when the game uses a very-custom in-house engine, and the file formats have to be reverse-engineered in order to make new stages and levels.</p>



<p>But anyways, I know this was a really random, unedited blog post, but I just wanted to write about something that is interesting to me.</p>
