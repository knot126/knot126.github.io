<p><em>Please note: This article was from 2021 and is now out of date. I have republished it for preservation purposes only!</em></p>



<p>I am having issues deciding the details about how the set of modding tools that I maintain, called Mediocre Tools, should be released in the future. While I know the general direction, I am not really sure if there needs to be an intermediate release. In order to help me figure out how exactly I am going to plan everything, I decided that I am going to write about it. I am also making this public, so people who depend on my tools know what changes are coming – they are major changes.</p>



<p>Firstly, I am making a new segment editor for Smash Hit. This is not the re-write of blender tools I once wrote about on the Smashing Mods wiki, but instead a “real” segment editor for Smash Hit that is made in Godot. (Note that I say “segement” and not “level” since the only thing it will be able to do is edit segments at first.) At this time, it is nowhere near ready for use. (I am having trouble with item selection – and property editing may be a pain as well. I am not an expert at this kind of stuff, unfortunately.) The project is simply called Carambola (a fancy word for star fruit) and the sources will be shipped in the next Mediocre Tools package, since they are already in the master repo. (Fun fact: The mediocre tools package is directly generated by doing a <code>git archive</code> on the current version.)</p>



<p>Secondly, I am questioning what I should do with blender tools. To make it very clear: I do not want to stop supporting blender tools until all of the features of Blender Tools 0.109 are available in Carambola, perhaps minus water. (No cheating by removing features!) Though, I do question weather I should keep trying to add features to Blender Tools or only continue with bug fixes and removing unneeded or broken features. The latest version of Blender Tools (0.109.0 at time of writing) is already a downgrade over 0.108 since lots of features that are useful for specific use cases (VR Multiply, Stonehack) were removed. In 0.110, I have considered adding template support, but I have not really tried to do it.</p>



<p>The third item on the list is MeshBake, which needs to be rewritten. Even since I first wrote the tool about three weeks ago, I’ve learned a lot about Vector and Matrix math and I would like to make the tool take advantage of at least one of them. In addition, the tool is <em>really</em> slow, which is something I would like to improve upon. For the re-write of MeshBake, I am considering writing the tool in the <a href="https://dlang.org">D language</a>. The other possible candidate is using the C toolkit I am working on (which is called Trestle) for my own engine as part of MeshBake, though that toolkit has many issues (For example, I have still not rewritten the buggy memory allocator from the first post).</p>



<p>For those asking about MTXBake/MTXTool (which I doubt there are given that I have seen zero custom images in Smash Hit mods), I only plan to add MTX to PNG support to MTXBake “someday,” though I have an internal (and really, REALLY poorly written) tool called MTXTool that can do that already. (If you’d like me to rip any of the images from Smash Hit, please let me know. The tool doesn’t support all of the images, but most of them will work.)</p>



<p>Ultimately, I think the future of Mediocre Tools is fairly solid so long as I have the time to maintain it, something which I constantly question if I have.</p>
